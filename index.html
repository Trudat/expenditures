<h3>Expenditure Authorities</h3>

<p>Expenditure authorities are approvals from Parliament for individual government organizations to spend up to specific amounts. Expenditure authority from Parliament is provided in two ways:</p>

<p>Annual appropriation acts that specify the amounts and broad purposes for which funds can be spent; and
Other specific statutes that authorize payments and set out the amounts and time periods for those payments.
An organization’s expenditure authority received through appropriation acts may be supplemented by allocations from Treasury Board Central Votes 5, 10, 15, 25, 30 and 33.</p>

<p>The following table is updated on a monthly basis to reflect the latest available information on in-year expenditure authorities:</p>

<p>2012–13 Expenditure Authorities as of February 28, 2013 (xHTML) (XLS, 156 kb)
Note: Totals in the xHTML version may not add due to rounding. If there is a discrepancy between the xHTML version and the XLS version of this dataset, the XLS version will prevail.</p>

<h3>Explanation of the Expenditure Authorities Table</h3>

<p>Authorities and Actual Expenditures as per the Public Accounts of Canada (2009-10 to 2011-12)
Following the end of a given fiscal year, final information becomes available on the use of expenditure authorities approved by Parliament and/or Treasury Board. The following tables, based on Volume II of the Public Accounts of Canada, present a high-level overview of the actual expenditures of organizations that receive appropriations from Parliament. New tables will be available annually following the release of the Public Accounts of Canada.
If there is a discrepancy between a table and the Public Accounts of Canada, the Public Accounts of Canada will prevail</p>
